# Understanding Tokens vs. Blockchains  
*A simple guide for anyone exploring crypto*

## 🌐 1. Blockchains Have a Native Coin  
Every blockchain has its own built-in currency that powers the entire network:

- Bitcoin → BTC  
- Ethereum → ETH  
- Solana → SOL  

These native coins are part of the blockchain itself.  
They pay network fees, run the system, and provide security.

Think of them as the official currency of a country.

## 🔧 2. Tokens Are Not Their Own Blockchains  
Most coins you hear about — like USDC, SHIB, APE, or LINK — are NOT separate blockchains.  
They are smart contracts that live inside a larger network (like Ethereum).

Tokens do not have:
- their own miners or validators  
- their own consensus system  
- their own blockchain  

They fully rely on the parent chain for everything.

Think of tokens as apps running inside a smartphone.  
The phone (Ethereum) provides the power; the app (token) uses it.

## 📊 3. Tokens Simply Track Balances  
A token contract keeps a simple list of who owns how much.  
Those balance entries ARE your tokens.

There is no separate chain storing this data —  
it's all inside the smart contract on the base network.

---

## 🔒 4. Why This Matters  
Because tokens all share the same base chain, they also share:

- gas fees  
- security  
- block space  
- congestion  
- validator processing  
- storage limits  

Tokens depend on the blockchain the same way apps depend on an operating system.

## 🎯 5. Quick Summary  
- Native coins (ETH, BTC, SOL) = the blockchain’s built-in currency.  
- Tokens = smart contracts living inside a blockchain.  
- Tokens do NOT have separate chains — they exist entirely within a parent network.

This model makes it easy to understand how crypto ecosystems really work.
