# synapses ⚡

A living stream of consciousness — bursts of insight, emotion, and reflection.  
Each note is a spark: unfiltered, unfinished, and essential.  
This is not a polished blog. It's a synaptic playground.

## Structure

Notes are organized loosely by theme (e.g., `psychology/`), but the point is to capture, not perfect.

## Why "synapses"?

A **synapse** is the electric space between neurons — where thoughts leap.  
This repo holds those leaps.
