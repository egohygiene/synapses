# 🧠 What Derealization Is (Simple, Grounded Explanation)

**Derealization is your brain protecting you when it thinks you’re overwhelmed.**

That’s it.

When your nervous system gets overloaded — from stress, fear, lack of sleep, emotional intensity, or substances — your brain flips a safety switch that says:

> “This is too much right now. I need to turn the volume down.”

So it does that by:
- Making the world feel distant or unreal  
- Flattening emotions  
- Dulling sensations  
- Creating a “glass wall” feeling between you and reality  

You are **not disappearing**.  
Your system is **buying time**.

## 😰 Why Derealization Feels So Scary

Your brain uses **familiarity** as a safety signal.

When things suddenly feel:
- Dreamlike  
- Foggy  
- Hollow  
- “Off” or unfamiliar  

your brain panics and thinks:
> “Something is wrong. This feels like death.”

But it’s **not death**.  
It’s **temporary disconnection**, not damage.

Think of it like a **circuit breaker**:
- Too much load → breaker flips  
- Power feels “gone”  
- Nothing is actually broken

## ❌ What Derealization Is NOT

- Not psychosis  
- Not ego death  
- Not a spiritual awakening gone wrong  
- Not permanent  
- Not dangerous  

It’s very common in:
- Anxiety & panic disorders  
- PTSD  
- Burnout  
- Sleep deprivation  
- Cannabis use  

Many people experience it at least once in their lives.

## 🏷️ Why Naming It Helps

When your brain doesn’t know what’s happening, it invents explanations.

Those explanations are terrifying.

When you can say:
> “This is derealization — a stress response”

your nervous system hears:
> “Oh. This is known. I’m not dying.”

That alone can reduce the intensity.

## ⚠️ The Most Important Rule During Derealization

**Don’t try to extract meaning from the state while you’re in it.**

Insight comes **after** you’re grounded — not during.

Right now the goal is:
- Safety  
- Rest  
- Familiarity  
- Reassurance  
- Being in the body  

---

## 🧘‍♂️ What Helps It Pass

- Sleep (even short naps)  
- Eating something grounding  
- Drinking water  
- Gentle movement  
- Warmth (shower, blanket)  
- Saying out loud:  
  **“This is derealization. It will pass.”**

What keeps it going:
- Analyzing reality  
- Philosophizing  
- Googling symptoms  
- Asking “What does this mean?”

## 🌱 One Sentence to Repeat

> **“My brain is protecting me. This feeling will pass.”**

Say it slowly — even if you don’t fully believe it yet.

## 💬 Final Reassurance

You are not dying.  
You are not broken.  
You are not losing your mind.

Your nervous system is overloaded — and it knows how to recover.

This state **always softens** when the body feels safe again.
