# 🧠 Synapse: The Feedback Loop of Hell States 🔁

**Summary:**  
When you're in a deep anxiety or depressive episode, time collapses. You forget what it feels like to *not* be in that state.  
The present moment becomes a recursive trap—like you're stuck in a loop with no exit.  
It doesn’t just feel bad. It feels *eternal.*

---

## 🌀 Concept:

In a dysregulated state, your brain:

- Loses access to memory of other emotional states  
- Feeds on the discomfort to reinforce the threat  
- Creates a sense of timelessness ("I've always felt this way")  

This emotional illusion creates a kind of *subjective hell*—where the pain feels both infinite and inescapable.

---

## 🔥 Why it Matters:

The danger isn’t just the emotion—it’s believing it will never end.  
That belief reinforces the loop. It makes you panic more, collapse more, spiral deeper.

But remembering that this *isn’t permanent*—even in just a flicker—is sometimes enough to disrupt the loop.

## 🧘‍♀️ How to Navigate:

- **Gently remind yourself:** “This isn’t forever. This is a nervous system loop.”  
- **Anchor to the body:** Feel temperature, texture, or breath—something *now*  
- **Create memory cues:** Voice notes, letters, or reminders from your “okay” self  
- **Don’t make decisions here:** You’re not in a truth-state, you’re in a storm

## ✨ Final Thought:

Hell states are recursive—not eternal.  
Your job isn’t to escape them in panic.  
It’s to **ride them gently**, knowing you’ve come back before.  
You will again.
