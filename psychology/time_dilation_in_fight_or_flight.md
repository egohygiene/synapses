# 🧠 Synapse: Time Dilation in Fight-or-Flight ⏳⚡

**Summary:**  
When you’re in fight-or-flight, time feels… wrong.  
Faster. Shallower. Everything’s moving, but you're not really *in* it.  
That’s because your amygdala is driving the ship—and it’s not interested in nuance, memory, or depth.  
It just wants you to **survive**.

## 🧠 Concept:

Fight-or-flight mode warps perception:  
- You stop encoding memory deeply  
- Your senses become heightened, but narrow  
- You process *quickly*, but not *comprehensively*  
- Time speeds up because you're not grounded enough to experience it fully

So it feels like life is flying past you, but you're frozen inside.  
And the more you're forced to survive—due to trauma, poverty, instability—the more that loop becomes your **default state**.

This is what systems of pressure, oppression, or burnout do:  
They keep people locked in survival mode, which robs them of time, perspective, and long-term vision.

## 🔥 Why it Matters:

Being in constant fight-or-flight isn’t just exhausting.  
It literally robs you of the *experience of life.*  
And the more people are forced to survive, the harder it becomes to imagine, plan, or heal.  
It shrinks the self down to *this moment only.* And then blames you for not thinking long-term.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Navigate:

- Practice slow embodiment: long exhales, warm food, grounded routines  
- Reclaim your sense of time by anchoring in memory, journaling, or stillness  
- If you feel like you can’t *slow down*, that’s the first sign you need to  
- See your fight-or-flight state not as failure, but as **adaptive intelligence** that now needs retraining

## ✨ Final Thought:

> Survival speeds you up.  
> Healing slows you down.

If time feels like it’s slipping away, you’re probably just stuck in protection mode.  
And it’s not your fault.

But you *deserve* to get your time back.
