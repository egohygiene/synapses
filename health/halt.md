# Check the Basics (HALT + Body Signals)

- **Hungry** → irritability, self-criticism, “angry at myself”
- **Thirsty** → tension, headaches, “angry at the world”
- **Lonely** → sadness, emptiness, craving connection
- **Tired** → overwhelm, hopelessness, everything feels harder

✨ Before assuming it’s a big problem, check if your body just needs food, water, rest, or connection.
